## Operation Modes

### Continuous Mode (Timer-Triggered)
- ADC samples are taken at a fixed rate of 10kHz
- Timer3 is used to trigger ADC conversions
- Data is continuously transmitted when 200 samples are collected
- Ideal for periodic signal monitoring and analysis
- **Note:** This mode is currently experiencing some issues where interrupts cause distortion to the ADC signal

### Interrupt Mode (Event-Triggered)
- ADC sampling begins when a rising edge is detected on PA1
- Precise timestamping of the trigger event
- Sampling continues until the specified number of samples is collected
- Ideal for capturing transient events and analyzing signals in response to external triggers
- **Recommended:** This mode is working well and provides reliable results

## OLTC-Specific Analysis

### Understanding the OLTC with Vacuum Interrupter
The On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC) with vacuum interrupters has specific characteristics:
- The arcing current goes to zero before the recovery voltage appears
- Re-ignition voltage is a critical parameter for OLTC performance
- Phase angle calculations represent the delay between current zero and recovery voltage

### Interpreting the Results
- **Current Zero-Crossings:** Points where the arcing current passes through zero
- **Voltage Zero-Crossings:** Derived from LED signal pulses, representing re-ignition voltage events
- **Phase Angle:** Represents the delay between current extinction and voltage recovery, measured in degrees (relative to 50/60Hz period)
- **Arc Duration:** Time between arc ignition and extinction, critical for OLTC performance evaluation

### Advanced Analysis
- The application automatically excludes the initial burst of pulses for accurate phase calculations
- Statistical analysis helps identify variations in phase angles across multiple cycles
- Frequency and amplitude calculations provide insights into current characteristics
